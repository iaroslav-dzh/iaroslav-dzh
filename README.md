## About me

I am interested in data analyst career. Since it pretty much suits my personal traits and interests.
1. I am eager to analyze
2. Finding causal relationships and patterns feels engaging for me
3. I like modelling scenarios and their outcomes - also with use of python
4. I like forming and testing hypotheses
5. I am patient and ready to learn new<br>

Fields of data analytics I'm interested in:
1. product analytics
2. antifraud analytics<br>

For now I have my first and only analytics project. It's a bank transactions simulator.
It generates synthetic dataset of legal and fraudulent transactions and writes it to a file.
You have a look at it in `fraud_txns_simulator` repo.
